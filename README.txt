Block out your Drupal site on January 18, 2012!

This module does just that, via a quick hack.

Your site will work normally until January 18, but on January 18 you
will only be able to access URLs starting with "user" and "admin"
without seeing the SOPA blackout page.

Developed for/tested with Drupal 6.

Shameless ripoff of WP-SOPA-Blackout:

Let me know if there's any problems with this version.
